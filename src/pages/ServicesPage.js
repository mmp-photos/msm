                   in a way that benefits your customers?

                <p>Comedy ain't easy.</p>
                <p>Reaching the right audience in the right way is a skill that few freelancers can master.  As a life-long
                   student of humor, messaging and marketing I am able to help capitalize on comedy.  From smart sarcasm to
                   silly puns I can deliver anything short of a Dick Van Dyke pratfall.
