        content: 'This artwork was created to promote the 10 minute play Terms and Conditions.  The play is about a man who purchases a robot to be his girlfriend. I wanted the artwork to convey a few messages.  Firstly the idea of the female robot as property, and also the ease with which people will accept terms without having made an effort to understand them. Sadly the main character agreed to them rather cavalierly, and that will be his undoing.'
